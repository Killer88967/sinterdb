# SinterDB Wire Protocol Version 1

Status: Experimental  
Protocol version: `1`  
Introduced by: SinterDB `0.0.2`

> [!WARNING]
> Protocol version 1 is under active development and may change before
> SinterDB reaches a stable release.

## 1. Conventions

The terms **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY**
describe protocol requirements.

All multibyte numeric values use big-endian network byte order.

Sizes and offsets are measured in bytes.

## 2. Transport

Protocol version 1 uses TCP.

TCP does not preserve application message boundaries. A receiver MUST support:

- Headers split across multiple TCP chunks
- Payloads split across multiple TCP chunks
- Multiple complete frames in one TCP chunk
- A complete frame followed by part of another frame

A receiver MUST buffer incomplete frames until enough bytes are available.

## 3. Frame Format

Every message is contained in a binary frame with a fixed 16-byte header.

| Offset | Size | Type   | Field            |
| -----: | ---: | ------ | ---------------- |
|      0 |    4 | Bytes  | Magic signature  |
|      4 |    2 | UInt16 | Protocol version |
|      6 |    1 | UInt8  | Message kind     |
|      7 |    1 | UInt8  | Flags            |
|      8 |    4 | UInt32 | Request ID       |
|     12 |    4 | UInt32 | Payload length   |
|     16 |    N | Bytes  | Encoded payload  |

### 3.1 Magic signature

The first four bytes MUST contain ASCII `SNTR`:

```text
53 4e 54 52
```

A receiver MUST reject any other signature.

### 3.2 Protocol version

The initial protocol version is:

```text
00 01
```

A receiver MUST reject unsupported protocol versions with a specific protocol
error.

Package versions and wire-protocol versions are independent.

### 3.3 Message kinds

| Value  | Name         | Purpose                                           |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x01` | `Handshake`  | Client/server identity and capability negotiation |
| `0x02` | `Ping`       | Connection health request                         |
| `0x03` | `Command`    | Database operation request                        |
| `0x04` | `Result`     | Successful non-streamed result                    |
| `0x05` | `StreamItem` | One item in a streamed result                     |
| `0x06` | `StreamEnd`  | Successful completion of a streamed result        |
| `0x07` | `Error`      | Failed request or connection-level failure        |

Unknown message kinds MUST be rejected.

### 3.4 Flags

| Bit | Value  | Name   | Meaning                                   |
| --: | ------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
|   0 | `0x01` | `More` | Additional correlated frames are expected |

A flags value of `0x00` means no flags are active.

All currently undefined flag bits MUST be zero. A receiver MUST reject frames
containing unsupported flag bits.

`More` is advisory for streamed responses. A `StreamEnd` message remains the
authoritative end of a streamed response.

### 3.5 Request IDs

Request IDs are unsigned 32-bit integers.

- `0` is reserved for uncorrelated or connection-level messages.
- Generated request IDs range from `1` through `4294967295`.
- After `4294967295`, a generator wraps to `1`.
- Responses MUST use the request ID of their corresponding request.
- Concurrent requests on one connection MUST use distinct active IDs.

A driver MUST NOT reuse an ID while a request with that ID is still active.

### 3.6 Payload length

Payload length is the number of bytes following the frame header.

The maximum payload length is `16,777,216` bytes (16 MiB). Therefore, the
maximum complete frame length is `16,777,232` bytes.

A receiver MUST reject payload declarations larger than this limit before
waiting for the payload body.

A standalone frame decoder MUST reject unexpected trailing bytes. An
incremental stream decoder MAY treat trailing bytes as the beginning of the
next frame.

## 4. Document Encoding

Message payloads use the SinterDB typed binary document encoding.

Every encoded value begins with a one-byte type tag.

| Tag    | Name     | Encoded data                                  |
| ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `0x00` | Null     | No additional bytes                           |
| `0x01` | False    | No additional bytes                           |
| `0x02` | True     | No additional bytes                           |
| `0x03` | Int32    | Signed 32-bit integer                         |
| `0x04` | Int64    | Signed 64-bit safe JavaScript integer         |
| `0x05` | Float64  | IEEE 754 binary64                             |
| `0x06` | BigInt64 | Signed 64-bit bigint                          |
| `0x07` | String   | UInt32 byte length followed by UTF-8          |
| `0x08` | Binary   | UInt32 byte length followed by raw bytes      |
| `0x09` | DateTime | Signed 64-bit Unix epoch milliseconds         |
| `0x0a` | Array    | UInt32 item count followed by encoded values  |
| `0x0b` | Document | UInt32 field count followed by encoded fields |

Unknown type tags MUST be rejected.

### 4.1 Numbers

JavaScript numbers are encoded using these rules:

1. An integer within the signed 32-bit range uses `Int32`.
2. Any other safe integer uses `Int64`.
3. All remaining numbers use `Float64`.

`Float64` includes:

- Fractional values
- Positive and negative infinity
- Negative zero
- `NaN`

Encoders MUST emit the canonical quiet-NaN representation:

```text
7f f8 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

Decoders MAY accept other valid IEEE 754 NaN representations.

An `Int64` value outside JavaScript’s safe-integer range MUST be rejected.
Applications requiring the full signed 64-bit range MUST use `BigInt64`.

### 4.2 Bigints

A bigint MUST fit within the signed 64-bit range:

```text
-9223372036854775808 through 9223372036854775807
```

Values outside this range MUST be rejected.

`BigInt64` decodes to JavaScript `bigint`, while `Int32` and `Int64` decode to
JavaScript `number`.

### 4.3 Strings

Strings use well-formed UTF-8.

Their encoding is:

| Size | Field                       |
| ---: | --------------------------- |
|    4 | UTF-8 byte length as UInt32 |
|    N | UTF-8 bytes                 |

Strings and document keys containing unpaired UTF-16 surrogates MUST be
rejected because they cannot round-trip through UTF-8 without modification.

Unicode normalization is not performed. Canonically equivalent strings remain
distinct unless an application normalizes them before encoding.

Invalid UTF-8 MUST be rejected while decoding.

### 4.4 Binary data

Binary data is encoded as:

| Size | Field                 |
| ---: | --------------------- |
|    4 | Byte length as UInt32 |
|    N | Raw bytes             |

Binary values decode to `Uint8Array`.

### 4.5 Dates

Dates are encoded as signed 64-bit Unix epoch milliseconds.

Invalid JavaScript `Date` values and decoded dates outside the JavaScript date
range MUST be rejected.

Dates decode to JavaScript `Date`.

### 4.6 Arrays

Arrays are encoded as:

| Size | Field                      |
| ---: | -------------------------- |
|    4 | Item count as UInt32       |
|    N | Consecutive encoded values |

Array order is preserved.

### 4.7 Documents

Documents are encoded as:

| Size | Field                 |
| ---: | --------------------- |
|    4 | Field count as UInt32 |
|    N | Consecutive fields    |

Each field is encoded as:

|     Size | Field                     |
| -------: | ------------------------- |
|        4 | Key byte length as UInt32 |
|        N | UTF-8 key bytes           |
| Variable | Encoded value             |

Encoders MUST sort fields lexicographically by their encoded UTF-8 key bytes.
This provides deterministic output across programming languages.

Decoders MUST reject duplicate keys.

Only plain objects are valid documents. Functions, symbols, `undefined`,
custom class instances, and other unsupported values MUST be rejected.

Cyclic arrays and documents MUST be rejected. Repeated non-cyclic values MAY
be encoded independently.

### 4.8 Nesting limit

The maximum document and array nesting depth is `100`.

Values exceeding that depth MUST be rejected by both encoders and decoders.

### 4.9 Complete-value requirement

A standalone value decoder MUST consume the complete provided byte sequence.

Unexpected trailing bytes, incomplete values, invalid lengths, and unknown
tags MUST produce specific protocol errors.

## 5. Message Payloads

Every frame payload MUST contain a top-level encoded document.

Receivers MAY ignore unknown fields whose values use supported document types.
This permits compatible protocol extensions.

### 5.1 Handshake

| Field             | Type                     | Required | Description                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `role`            | String                   | Yes      | `client` or `server`                   |
| `protocolVersion` | UInt16-compatible number | Yes      | Requested or accepted protocol version |
| `product`         | Non-empty string         | Yes      | Product identifier                     |
| `productVersion`  | Non-empty string         | Yes      | Product package version                |
| `capabilities`    | String array             | Yes      | Supported capability identifiers       |

Initial known capabilities are:

- `typed-documents`

Unknown capability strings MUST be preserved during decoding and MAY be
ignored when determining the negotiated feature set.

### 5.2 Ping

| Field    | Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `sentAt` | DateTime | Yes      |

A successful ping receives a `Result` using the same request ID.

### 5.3 Command

| Field        | Type             | Required | Description                 |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| `command`    | Non-empty string | Yes      | Command name                |
| `database`   | Non-empty string | No       | Target logical database     |
| `parameters` | Document         | Yes      | Command-specific parameters |

An omitted optional field MUST not be encoded as `undefined`.

### 5.4 Result

| Field   | Type                | Required |
| ------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| `value` | Any supported value | Yes      |

### 5.5 Stream item

| Field      | Type                      | Required |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | -------- |
| `sequence` | Non-negative safe integer | Yes      |
| `value`    | Any supported value       | Yes      |

Sequence numbers begin at `0` and increase by one for each item in the same
stream.

### 5.6 Stream end

| Field   | Type                      | Required |
| ------- | ------------------------- | -------- |
| `count` | Non-negative safe integer | Yes      |

`count` is the total number of emitted stream items.

### 5.7 Error

| Field       | Type                     | Required |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| `code`      | UInt32-compatible number | Yes      |
| `name`      | Non-empty string         | Yes      |
| `message`   | Non-empty string         | Yes      |
| `retryable` | Boolean                  | Yes      |
| `details`   | Document                 | No       |

Unknown numeric wire error codes MUST remain decodable so newer servers can
communicate with older clients.

## 6. Wire Error Codes

Local codec failures use string-based `ProtocolErrorCode` values. Errors sent
across a connection use numeric `WireErrorCode` values.

### 6.1 Protocol and request errors

| Code | Name                         |
| ---: | ---------------------------- |
| 1000 | `InvalidRequest`             |
| 1001 | `UnsupportedProtocolVersion` |
| 1002 | `UnsupportedCapability`      |
| 1003 | `UnknownCommand`             |
| 1004 | `RequestTimeout`             |

### 6.2 Authentication and authorization errors

| Code | Name                     |
| ---: | ------------------------ |
| 2000 | `AuthenticationRequired` |
| 2001 | `AuthenticationFailed`   |
| 2002 | `PermissionDenied`       |

### 6.3 Namespace errors

| Code | Name                |
| ---: | ------------------- |
| 3000 | `NamespaceNotFound` |
| 3001 | `NamespaceConflict` |

### 6.4 Internal errors

| Code | Name            |
| ---: | --------------- |
| 9000 | `InternalError` |

Published numeric codes MUST NOT be reassigned to different meanings.

## 7. Response Behavior

A request produces one of the following:

- One `Result`
- One `Error`
- Zero or more `StreamItem` messages followed by one `StreamEnd`
- Zero or more `StreamItem` messages followed by one `Error`

All correlated response frames MUST use the originating request ID.

A connection-level `Error` MAY use request ID `0`.

## 8. Invalid Input

A receiver MUST reject at least the following:

- Invalid magic signatures
- Unsupported protocol versions
- Unknown message kinds
- Unsupported flag bits
- Oversized payload declarations
- Incomplete frames when the input stream ends
- Payload-length mismatches
- Unknown document tags
- Invalid UTF-8
- Unsafe `Int64` values
- Invalid dates
- Duplicate document keys
- Excessive nesting
- Invalid message envelope fields
- Unexpected bytes after a standalone frame or value

A server SHOULD close a connection after an unrecoverable framing error because
the next valid frame boundary may no longer be known.

## 9. Golden Fixtures

Canonical protocol fixtures are stored at:

```text
packages/protocol/fixtures/protocol-v1.json
```

Their JSON Schema is stored at:

```text
packages/protocol/schemas/golden-fixtures.schema.json
```

Implementations SHOULD verify their encoders and decoders against these
fixtures.

Changing existing golden bytes requires either:

- A compatible correction with documented migration impact, or
- A new wire-protocol version

## 10. Compatibility

Protocol changes that alter frame interpretation, type tags, canonical bytes,
or required envelope fields require a new protocol version.

Adding optional envelope fields, new capability strings, or new numeric error
codes does not necessarily require a new protocol version when older
implementations can safely ignore them.
