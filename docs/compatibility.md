# Compatibility and versioning

SinterDB is pre-1.0, and `0.x` releases can still change. From `0.1.0` onward
the project makes the promises on this page, so that a developer preview is
something you can build a real local project on.

The short version:

- **Patch releases (`0.1.x`)** fix bugs. They do not change the public API, the
  wire protocol, or the on-disk format, and they never intentionally make an
  existing data directory unreadable.
- **Minor releases (`0.x.0`)** may make breaking changes. Every breaking change
  is listed under [Migration notes](#migration-notes) with what to do about it.
- **Your data is never read wrongly.** A server that does not understand a data
  directory refuses to open it with a clear error. It does not guess.

## Format versions

These are the versions of the formats SinterDB reads and writes today. A test
checks this table against the code, so a release cannot change a format without
this page changing too.

| Format                   | Constant                    | Version |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------- |
| Wire protocol            | `PROTOCOL_VERSION`          | 1       |
| Storage directory        | `STORAGE_FORMAT_VERSION`    | 2       |
| Snapshot (checkpoint)    | `CHECKPOINT_FORMAT_VERSION` | 2       |
| Write-ahead log segments | `WAL_FORMAT_VERSION`        | 1       |

## Data files

- A server opens data directories written by any release from `0.0.8` on.
  Older directories are upgraded in place when first opened, before anything is
  written. The manifest records `upgradedFrom` and `upgradedAt`.
- **Upgrades are one way.** After an upgrade, an older server refuses the
  directory with an "Upgrade" error instead of ignoring data it does not
  understand. Copy the data directory before upgrading across a storage format
  change (stop the server first, then copy the whole directory).
- Patch releases never change a format version.
- A minor release that changes a format version says so in its release notes and
  in [Migration notes](#migration-notes), and either upgrades in place or gives
  explicit steps.
- A damaged or unrecognised file is reported with its path and offset. It is
  never skipped silently.

## Wire protocol

- A driver and a server talk only if their `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is equal. The
  handshake checks it, and a mismatch fails with `UnsupportedProtocolVersion`
  (wire code 1001) on the server or `SinterCompatibilityError` in the driver.
- Within one protocol version, commands and optional fields can be added but
  never removed or changed. A new driver calling a command an older server does
  not have gets `UnknownCommand` (wire code 1003). Run a driver and a server
  from the same minor release when you can.
- Raising `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is a breaking change and needs a minor release.
- Wire error codes are never renumbered or reused. New codes are added.

## The `sinterdb` driver API

The public API is what `sinterdb` exports. The list is recorded in
`packages/driver/etc/sinterdb.api.md`, and CI fails when it changes without that
file being updated, so every change to the public surface shows up in review.

Covered by the promise:

- Classes, functions, constants, and types exported from `sinterdb`, including
  the TypeScript types that appear in their signatures. Removing or renaming
  one, or changing what it does, is a breaking change.
- `SinterErrorCode` string values and the error class hierarchy.
- The [connection-string format](./connection-strings.md). A string that works
  today keeps working. Reserved parts (credentials, query parameters,
  fragments) are rejected today and may gain a meaning in a later release.
- Result shapes returned by CRUD, cursor, and index methods.

Not covered:

- **Anything marked `@beta`**, such as `explain()` and its result type. It can
  change in any release. Release notes mention changes.
- Error message text. Match on the error class or code.
- Type-level helper types (for example `FilterPaths`). Their names are public,
  but we may refine what they accept as TypeScript improves. Changes that make
  correct code stop compiling are treated as breaking.
- Performance characteristics.
- Anything imported from a path other than the package root.

Driver releases support Node.js 24 and later. Dropping a Node.js version is a
breaking change.

| `@sinterdb/cli`        | The `sinterd` command-line flags, environment variables, and exit codes, as listed in [configuration.md](./configuration.md). The format of log lines is for people and is not covered. |
| `sinterdb-protocol`    | Low-level wire codec. It follows `PROTOCOL_VERSION`: breaking changes ship in a minor release, and most applications never import it.                                                   |
| `@sinterdb-internal/*` | Internal. Not published and not covered.                                                                                                                                                |

## Migration notes

Each breaking change lands here in the release that makes it.

### 0.1.0

- **The CLI package is `@sinterdb/cli`.** Earlier GitHub release tarballs named
  it `sinterdb-server`. Install it with `npm install -g @sinterdb/cli`. The
  executable is still `sinterd`. The name `sinterdb-server` that the server
  reports in the handshake is a protocol identifier and did not change.
- **The driver's public API is now an explicit list.** These helpers were
  exported by accident and are no longer public: `parseSinterConnectionString`,
  `parseCreateIndexResult`, `parseIndexList`, `parseExplainResult`,
  `parseIndexValidation`, `DRIVER_PRODUCT`, and `DRIVER_PRODUCT_VERSION`. Use
  `new SinterClient(connectionString)` and read `client.target` for the parsed
  host, port, and database.
- **Connection strings are stricter.** These were accepted before and are now
  rejected with `SinterConnectionStringError`: an empty `?` or `#`, whitespace
  inside the string, and a non-ASCII host name (the driver would have tried to
  resolve a percent-encoded name that cannot exist). See
  [connection-strings.md](./connection-strings.md).
- No data or protocol format changed. Storage format 2, snapshot format 2, WAL
  format 1, and protocol 1 are the same as in `0.0.9`.

### 0.0.9

- **Storage format 1 became 2** to store index definitions. Directories are
  upgraded in place on first open, and the upgrade is one way: `0.0.8` refuses a
  format 2 directory. Copy your data directory before moving from `0.0.8`.
