# Custom Database, Node.js Driver, and ODM Roadmap

Status: Planning draft  
Working name: `SinterDB`  
Package scope: `@sinterdb-internal/*`  
License: Apache-2.0  
Primary language: TypeScript  
Package manager: pnpm

> `SinterDB`, its URI scheme, and its npm scope are placeholders until the project receives a final name.

## 1. Project Vision

Build a document-oriented database with three deliberately separate products:

1. **SinterDB Server** — owns storage, query execution, indexing, authentication, transactions, and replication.
2. **SinterDB Node.js Driver** — implements the wire protocol and exposes a typed `Client → Database → Collection → Cursor` API.
3. **SinterDB ODM** — an optional, separately published Mongoose-style modeling layer built on the public driver API.

The driver must remain useful without the ODM. The ODM must never import server internals or bypass the driver.

## 2. Non-Goals Before 1.0

- MongoDB wire-protocol compatibility
- SQL support
- Browser clients connecting directly to the database
- Multi-region consensus
- Sharding and automatic partition rebalancing
- A graphical administration application
- Compatibility with Mongoose models or plugins
- Supporting every JavaScript runtime before Node.js behavior is stable

## 3. Repository Strategy

Development begins in one monorepo so protocol, server, and driver changes can be tested atomically. The ODM is developed as a separate repository once the driver reaches `0.3.0`.

## 4. Package Responsibilities

| Package                         | Published                | Responsibility                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@sinterdb-internal/protocol`   | Initially private        | Versioned request/response types, framing, serialization, capabilities, and error codes |
| `@sinterdb-internal/storage`    | No                       | Data files, write-ahead log, checkpoints, indexes, recovery, and compaction             |
| `@sinterdb-internal/server`     | Optional                 | Query execution, sessions, authentication, transactions, and TCP server                 |
| `sinterdb-server`               | Optional executable      | CLI that configures and starts the server                                               |
| `sinterdb`                      | Yes                      | Official Node.js driver and primary public npm package                                  |
| `@sinterdb-internal/test-utils` | Later                    | Test-server lifecycle and fixtures for downstream packages                              |
| `sinterdb-odm`                  | Yes, separate repository | Schemas, models, validation, hooks, virtuals, and population                            |

## 5. Public Driver Shape

The intended low-level API is familiar without pretending to be MongoDB-compatible:

```ts
import { CustomClient, type Document } from "sinterdb";

interface User extends Document {
  username: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

const client = new CustomClient("sinterdb://127.0.0.1:4721");

await client.connect();

const users = client.db("app").collection<User>("users");

await users.insertOne({
  username: "Killer88967",
  createdAt: new Date(),
});

const user = await users.findOne({
  username: "Killer88967",
});

await client.close();
```

The public object hierarchy is:

```text
CustomClient
└── Database
    └── Collection<TDocument>
        └── Cursor<TDocument>
```

## 6. Wire Protocol Principles

- TCP transport for the first stable release.
- A fixed binary frame header containing a version, message kind, request ID, flags, and payload length.
- A deterministic typed document encoding rather than plain JSON.
- Dates, binary data, integers, nulls, arrays, and nested documents must preserve their types.
- Every request receives one response or an explicitly streamed sequence.
- Request IDs allow concurrent operations over one socket.
- Capability negotiation prevents newer drivers from silently using unsupported server features.
- Stable numeric error codes accompany human-readable messages.
- Limits for frame size, document size, nesting depth, batch size, and operation time are enforced on both sides.
- Protocol documentation and conformance fixtures are public contracts.

## 7. Versioning Rules

- Before `1.0.0`, minor releases may change experimental APIs but must include migration notes.
- Patch releases fix bugs and must not intentionally break documented behavior.
- Every protocol change declares its minimum driver and server versions.
- The driver and server can have independent package versions after `1.0.0`.
- Experimental exports live behind an `experimental` namespace or explicit option.
- Deprecations must warn for at least one minor release before removal.
- The ODM follows its own version line and only supports declared driver ranges.

# Release Roadmap

## `0.0.1` — Repository Foundation

**Goal:** Establish a publishable, testable workspace without pretending the database works yet.

### Deliverables

- pnpm workspace and shared TypeScript configuration
- Packages for `protocol`, `storage`, `server`, `driver`, and `test-utils`
- ESM-first builds with generated declaration files
- Root scripts for `build`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, and `format`
- Vitest unit-test setup
- Changesets release setup
- GitHub Actions for installation, typechecking, testing, and building
- Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`
- Initial architecture decision records
- Minimal package README files with explicit experimental warnings

### Repository layout

```text
packages/
├── driver/src/index.ts
├── protocol/src/index.ts
├── server/src/index.ts

└── test-utils/src/index.ts
```

### Exit criteria

- Request ID generation
- Message kinds for handshake, ping, command, result, stream item, stream end, and error
- Incremental decoder that handles partial and combined TCP chunks

### Exit criteria

- Typed documents can be inserted and read through the published driver API.
- IDs remain stable across serialization.

- Typed `Filter<TDocument>` API

### Exit criteria

- Large results are delivered in bounded batches.

```

### Exit criteria

- Acknowledged writes survive restart.
- Recovery ignores incomplete trailing records without accepting corrupt committed records.

# Quality Gates Applied to Every Release

Each release must include:

- Unit tests for changed logic
- Integration tests for behavior crossing package boundaries
- Type tests for the public driver or ODM API
- Protocol or storage fixtures when a format changes
- Documentation for new public behavior
- A changeset and changelog entry
- Clean installation and package tests
- No leaked sockets, timers, file handles, or cursors
- Dependency and license review
- A documented migration when compatibility changes

# Initial Issue Milestones

The roadmap should be mirrored into these milestones:

1. `0.0.1 — Foundation`
2. `0.0.2 — Protocol`
3. `0.0.3 — Server Lifecycle`
4. `0.0.4 — Driver Connection`
5. `0.0.5 — Insert and Read`
6. `0.0.6 — Queries and Cursors`
7. `0.0.7 — Complete CRUD`
8. `0.0.8 — Persistence`
9. `0.0.9 — Indexes`
10. `0.1.0 — Developer Preview`

Later milestones should be opened only after the developer preview validates the fundamental architecture.

# Decisions Required Before Implementing `0.0.1`

1. Final project, executable, URI scheme, npm package, and scope names
2. Whether the server remains TypeScript through `1.0` or may later move storage/query internals to Rust
3. Minimum supported Node.js version
4. ESM-only versus dual ESM/CommonJS publishing
5. Initial document encoding: a custom binary format or an existing specification with extensions
6. Default data directory and server port
7. Repository ownership and npm organization
8. Whether replication is mandatory for `1.0` or may move to `1.1`

# Recommended First Implementation Order

Once the naming decisions are complete, implementation should follow this order:

1. Create the workspace and package manifests.
2. Configure TypeScript, builds, tests, formatting, and CI.
3. Define protocol values and document encoding independently of sockets.
4. Add golden protocol fixtures.
5. Build the incremental frame decoder.
6. Start a TCP server with `ping`.
7. Connect through `CustomClient`.
8. Add one vertical data path: `insertOne` followed by `findOne`.

That vertical slice proves the package boundaries before more CRUD, persistence, indexes, authentication, or ODM work is added.
